          <p>I am a 21 year-old studying Informatics at the University of Michigan. This interdisciplinary major between the
            the College of Engineering, Department of Statistics and School of Information combines a study of human computer interaction,
            big data analysis, and software development. <br /><br />
            Through my studies and work experience, I cultivated my programming skills together with an understanding
            of how users interpret and understand what I create.<br /><br />
            I aspire to design and develop things that change people's lives in a positive way, whether it is
            making a mundane task easier or completely revolutionizing the way technology is involved in our lives.

                  include professional and personal projects. I am always
                  looking for the next API or web technology to hack on.

                    I found myself frustrated that there was nothing out there 
                    that could simply give me the closest NYC subway stops and tell
                    me when the next trains would arrive. So I decided to make a simple
                    app that does just that! I used MTA's Static Transit Data in conjunction with
                    Node.JS and Parse for handling the data on the backend along with 
                    Bootstrap and Javascript/jQuery to provide the output of the results.<br /><br />

                    At MHacks IV, I teamed up with three other great developers to build
                    Live Code, a collaborative coding platform. This application combines video chatting
                    with a shared code editor to allow for users to work together while programming or help
                    a friend out with a code error. We were selected as one of the top 25 teams out of over
                    250 submissions. I primararily designed on the frontend of the application, but also contributed
                    a few additional features to the backend. Technologies used include Bootstrap, jQuery, EJS, Node.JS, Parse, Socket.IO, WebRTC, SendGrid, and Ace.<br /><br />

I was responsible for establishing a system for task management, ensuring that work was efficiently distributed, and leading a weekly code review meeting to ensure software quality and to identify any issues that needed to be resolved. My main projects for the summer were building a web based Point of Sales system for use on tablets and an Analytics platform. Seat Side Service has expanded the number of products and services they could offer to prospective clients and closed new deals as a result of these new additions.

                    For the final project in a course in Evaluation of Systems and Services, I conducted a comprehensive usability study of the Highland Springs Resort website. As a part of a group of four others, we conducted interviews of individuals fitting the demographics of the website along with in person usability tests that involved analyzing the process of how people interacted with the website to perform certain tasks. We compiled all this information into a report that provided results from our work and recommendations on how to improve HS Resort's user experience.

                    As an intern at data management company SCDM, I gained valuable insight into the managerial side of software development.  Communicating with a team of software developers in a different country, and enforcing new standards in the way that their work was done took a delicate approach in order to not disrupt important projects in progress. Through the implementation of a project management system that allowed for more transparency in SCDM’s development processes, I learned how to plan, execute, and coordinate a drastic change in a company’s software development process. The numerous factors and level of planning required on my part to seamlessly transition employees to this new system gave me valuable insight into working as a software developer and how to coordinate a team in completing projects.

Working for Social Media Link gave me new experience in various facets of social media, including coding HTML in emails for marketing, performing MySQL database queries, and creating unique CSS styles for their corporate website.  I have bolstered the experience I gained in web development and social media in my academic pursuits with a Design of Complex Websites course as a part of my academic major at the University of Michigan.
