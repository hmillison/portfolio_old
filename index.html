          <h4>Software Developer</h4>
          <img class="faceshot" src="./images/topcirc.png" alt="Picture" width="140">
          <p>I am a 21 year-old studying Informatics at the University of Michigan. This interdisciplinary major between the
            the College of Engineering, Department of Statistics and School of Information combines a study of human computer interaction,
            big data analysis, and software development. <br /><br />
            Through my studies and work experience, I cultivated my programming skills together with an understanding
            of how users interpret and understand what I create.<br /><br />
            I aspire to design and develop things that change people's lives in a positive way, whether it is
            making a mundane task easier or completely revolutionizing the way technology is involved in our lives.<br /><br />
            My interests include web development, human computer interaction, data visualization, UI design, digital media, hackathons, entrepreneurship, cooking and music.

                   <p>My work at Seat Side Service combined the skills I have acquired in my previous positions, both software development and project management. I served as the liaison between the other developers in the office and the CEO, COO and CTO. I was responsible for establishing a system for task management, ensuring that work was efficiently distributed, and leading a weekly code review meeting to ensure software quality and to identify any issues that needed to be resolved. My main projects for the summer were building a web based Point of Sales system for use on tablets and an Analytics platform. Seat Side Service has expanded the number of products and services they could offer to prospective clients and closed new deals as a result of these new additions.</p>

                    <p> As an intern at data management company SCDM, I gained valuable insight into the managerial side of software development.  Communicating with a team of software developers in a different country, and enforcing new standards in the way that their work was done took a delicate approach in order to not disrupt important projects in progress. Through the implementation of a project management system that allowed for more transparency in SCDM’s development processes, I learned how to plan, execute, and coordinate a drastic change in a company’s software development process. The numerous factors and level of planning required on my part to seamlessly transition employees to this new system gave me valuable insight into working as a software developer and how to coordinate a team in completing projects.</p>

In addition to assigned tasks, I took it upon myself to redesign parts of their website and surveys in order to create a more aesthetically pleasing and modern look. Working for Social Media Link gave me new experience in various facets of social media, including coding HTML in emails for marketing, performing MySQL database queries, and creating unique CSS styles for their corporate website.  I have bolstered the experience I gained in web development and social media in my academic pursuits with a Design of Complex Websites course as a part of my academic major at the University of Michigan.

                    <h3>The Stock Bot</h3>
                    <p>For HackNY, my team decided to explore the Bloomberg API to provide real time stock information in an 
                    extremely easy to use way. The Inbox Messanger application provided an excellent platform for us to create
                    a bot that you can message quickly with company names and receive stock data combined with NY Times financial news in response. This project
                    was a great experience learning how to create an application that can effectively communicate with users. For the production
                    version, I transitioned the backend financial source from Bloomberg to Markitondemand. Technologies used included Node.JS, NYTimes API, Bloomberg API, Markitondemand APIs, and Inbox Messanger's API. <br /> You can try out the bot by messaging @thestockbot on Inbox Messanger</p>

                    <h3>Fixey</h3>
                    <p>As a part of a team at CalHacks, we created a web application that uses the Google Directions API to 
                    combine bicycle and public transportation data into the most efficient, healthy and eco-friendly way to get around.
                    The fundamental goal behind this project is to encourage people to use alternatives to driving. In addition to providing 
                    directions, we informed the users of how much gas money and carbon emissions they were saving by using our suggested route.
                    I built the front end map visualization for Fixey along with assisting with backend
                    processing of the data from Google Maps to GeoJSON. We won the prize for Best Health-Tech Hack. Technologies used included 
                    Boostrap, jQuery, Node.JS, Mapbox, D3.JS, and Leaflet</p>

                    <h3>New York Minute</h3>
                    <p>I found myself frustrated that there was nothing out there 
                    that could simply give me the closest NYC subway stops and tell
                    me when the next trains would arrive. So I decided to make a simple
                    app that does just that! I used MTA's Static Transit Data in conjunction with
                    Node.JS and Parse for handling the data on the backend along with 
                    Bootstrap and Javascript/jQuery to provide the output of the results. 
                    I am currently in the process of refactoring this project using AngularJS
                    to create a similar application for the University of Michigan Bus System to 
                    provide real time bus arrival times based on your location.</p>

                    <h3>Live_Code</h3>
                    <p> At MHacks IV, I teamed up with three other great developers to build
                    Live Code, a collaborative coding platform. This application combines video chatting
                    with a shared code editor to allow for users to work together while programming or help
                    a friend out with a code error. We were selected as one of the top 25 teams out of over
                    250 submissions. I primararily designed on the frontend of the application, but also contributed
                    a few additional features to the backend. Technologies used include Bootstrap, jQuery, EJS, Node.JS, Parse, Socket.IO, WebRTC, SendGrid, and Ace.</p>

                    I built Recipe Box to accomplish this! It's a recipe manager that scrapes a few popular food sites by URL or searches for recipes by ingredient or dish name. Technologies used include Bootstrap, jQuery, EJS, MongoDB, Node.JS, Cheerio, and Yummly's API.</p>
